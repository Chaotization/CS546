This page will be rendered when the following route is hit: GET http://localhost:3000/venuedetails/:id
This page will respond with a valid HTML document. The title of the document should be "Venue Details". You should have
the title set as the <title> element of the HTML document and as an h1 in your document inside a header element .

    Your page should reference a CSS file, /public/css/main-styles.css; this file should have at least 5 rulesets that
    apply to this page; these 5 rules can also apply to elements on /, or be unique to this page.

    You should have a main element, and inside of the main element have a div tag, inside the div tag you have the
    following children elements: In an h2 element, you will display the name of the venue, an img element that contains
    the image of the venue, you will set the source of the img to be the url for the venue image contained in the
    data(shown below in the images array) and set the alt attribute to the venue name (as shown below in sample HTML),
    an a element that will link to the venue's website in a new tab with the text "Venue Information on Ticketmaster",
    an address element that contains the text "Address:" and then display the address, the city, state, and postal code
    for that venue (in the data, these are the address.line1, city.name, state.stateCode and postalCode fields), and
    finally another address element that contains the text "Phone:" and then display the venue's phone number field
    (boxOfficeInfo.phoneNumberDetail field in the data). IF ANY OF THIS DATA IS MISSING FROM THE API, YOU WILL DISPLAY
    "N/A" FOR THE FIELDS THAT DO NOT HAVE DATA, IF THERE IS NO IMAGE FOR A VENUE, USE A "NO PHOTO" DEFAULT IMAGE (I have
    supplied one in the /public/images directory in the code stub)
